/**
 * A class for in-memory-storage of geotags
 * 
 * Use an array to store a multiset of geotags.
 * - The array must not be accessible from outside the store.
 * 
 * Provide a method 'addGeoTag' to add a geotag to the store.
 * 
 * Provide a method 'removeGeoTag' to delete geo-tags from the store by name.
 * 
 * Provide a method 'getNearbyGeoTags' that returns all geotags in the proximity of a location.
 * - The location is given as a parameter.
 * - The proximity is computed by means of a radius around the location.
 * 
 * Provide a method 'searchNearbyGeoTags' that returns all geotags in the proximity of a location that match a keyword.
 * - The proximity constrained is the same as for 'getNearbyGeoTags'.
 * - Keyword matching should include partial matches from name or hashtag fields.
